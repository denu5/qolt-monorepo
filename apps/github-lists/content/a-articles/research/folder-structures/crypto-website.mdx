<ProjectTree>
```
+ src
  + commands
    - placeOrderCommand.js
    - updateUserProfileCommand.js
  + queries
    - getMarketDataQuery.js
    - getUserPortfolioQuery.js
  + handlers
    + commandHandlers
      - placeOrderHandler.js
      - updateUserProfileHandler.js
    + queryHandlers
      - getMarketDataHandler.js
      - getUserPortfolioHandler.js
  + models
    + readModels
      - marketDataReadModel.js
      - userPortfolioReadModel.js
    + writeModels
      - orderWriteModel.js
      - userProfileWriteModel.js
  + services
    - commandBus.js
    - queryBus.js
  + utils
    - eventStore.js
