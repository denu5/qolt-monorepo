desc: I'm an avid window-seat traveler, captivated by the ever-changing views from above. Mountains, oceans, cities â€“ each flight is a gateway to a world of wonder. From the golden hues of a sunrise over the horizon to the intricate patterns of city lights at night, each flight offers an unrepeatable spectacle.
